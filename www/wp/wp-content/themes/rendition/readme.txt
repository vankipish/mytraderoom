Known Limitations:

Menu: Site menu does not display by default - you will need to allocate a menu to the theme location.
Menu: With Bootstrap the top level item on a dropdown menu is only meant as a pointer i.e. does not link out.
It is therefore recommended to use a custom link leaving the url blank to act as the pointer item and then add other pages to it as submenu items.
Header: Content within the header is governed by the set header height - it is therefore recommended to keep these i.e. Site Title, Site description and tab contents short and concise
Home (Blog Feed) layout is currently considered as a work in progress - there are some quarks  bugs that will need fixing/adjusting as and when a solid solution is found.
